# Planning

Total Time: 12 Weeks

( 6.19 -- 8.28 )

## Step 1: planning, background and reading

Time: 1 week ( 6.19 -- 6.25 )

1. Writing Plan ( 1 day )
2. Search material and finish the background ( 1 - 2 days )
3. Reading the tutorial about OpenCL API and SDL API ( the rest time )



## Step 2: design and development

Time: 3 weeks ( 6.26 -- 7.16 )

1. Reading and understanding the source code about the plain C uxn VM. ( 2 - 3 days )
2. Communicating with the supervisor to clarify any unclear aspects and determine which parts are relatively **easier to start with.** ( 1 - 2 days )
3. Coding the system ( the rest time )
4. Writing scripts which about Compilation and Execution ( the rest time )



## Step 3: Testing

Time: 2 weeks ( 7.17 -- 7.30 )

1. Searching for research papers and materials on how to test a VM (as I have no prior experience in testing virtual machine systems) ( 0.5 weeks)
2. Run and test this system on multiple platforms, including GPUs, CPUs, etc. ( the rest time )
3. Distribute this system to fellow group members who use it for their projects. Request them to use it and provide feedback on its usage. ( Proceed with both tasks simultaneously )
4. Search for methods for comparing carbon consumption across different platforms and use this system for comparison. ( 0.5 weeks )



## Step 4: Report/paper

Time: 2 weeks ( 7.31 -- 8.13 )

1. Finish the Background, System Explanation, Important Code Explanation, and Testing part and Finalize Draft (1 week )
2. Revise and Refine ( 1 week )



## Step 5: More

I don't know if there is a possibility of publishing this project in a journal in the end (I have only attempted to publish in a Chinese journal once before, and I know that the process can be particularly challenging) or if additional work needs to be done. I hope to do better.
